## Thanks

This library would have not been feasibly possible without the strong foundations of [fp-ts](https://github.com/gcanti/fp-ts) and [Waveguide](https://github.com/rzeigler/waveguide) from which we have forked the base bifunctor and execution runtime, huge thanks to the Authors.

This library was initially based on Fluture, huge thanks to the Authors.

Another huge thanks goes to both the scala community (ZIO in specific) and the haskell community (RIO & Polysemy) from which inspiration is taken.

All of the above projects are advised!
